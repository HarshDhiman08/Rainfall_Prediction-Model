# Rainfall_Prediction-Model
An interactive machine learning project that predicts whether it will rain based on meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and cloud cover. The project uses Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost models — automatically selecting the best one based on ROC-AUC performance.
